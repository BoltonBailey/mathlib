feat(data/polynomial/reverse): show trailing_coeff is a multiplicative homomorphism

use the `reflect` function.  prove lemmas on `trailing_degree`.  add a lemma on monotone non-increasing to show that `trailing_coeff` and `leading_coeff` are exchanged under `reflect`

feel free to suggest a better home for `mon` and `monotone_max'_min'`.
