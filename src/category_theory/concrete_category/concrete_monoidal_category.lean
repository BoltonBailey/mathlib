/--
A concrete monoidal category is a monoidal category whose forgetful functor to `Type` is lax
monoidal. A prototypical example to think about is `Vec`, equipped with tensor products as the
monoidal structure, forgetting to `Type`, equipped with cartesian products as the monoidal
structure. Observe that we have a map (in `Type`) `V √ó W ‚Üí V ‚äó W`, which is the lax tensorator, but
there is not a map in the other direction.
